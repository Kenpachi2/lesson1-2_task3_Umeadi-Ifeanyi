                <h2>Why build better habits?</h2>
                <p>
                    Building better habits is an essential component of personal
                    growth and development. Habits are the actions we take
                    automatically, without much thought, and they have a
                    significant impact on our lives. Whether you want to improve
                    your health, relationships, or career, developing positive
                    habits is <strong>essential.</strong>
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    There are many reasons why building better habits is
                    essential for personal growth and development. Here are a
                    few of the most important reasons:
                </p>

                <h2><li>Achieve Your Goals:</li></h2>
                Building better habits is an effective way to achieve your
                goals. When you develop positive habits, you create a consistent
                routine that helps you move closer to your objectives. By
                building habits that support your goals, you can make progress
                more quickly and efficiently.

                <h2><li>Improve YourHealth:</li></h2>
                Developing healthy habits, such as eating a balanced diet,
                exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep, can have a
                significant impact on your overall health and well-being. By
                building better habits, you can improve your physical health,
                mental health, and quality of life.

                <h2><li>Increase Productivity:</li></h2>
                Building better habits can also increase your productivity. When
                you have a consistent routine, you can accomplish more in less
                time, which can help you achieve your goals more quickly. For
                example, if you develop a habit of working on a specific task
                for a set amount of time each day, you'll make progress more
                efficiently than if you work on it sporadically.

                <h2><li>Reduce Stress:</li></h2>
                Developing positive habits can also help reduce stress. When you
                have a routine that you can rely on, you're less likely to feel
                overwhelmed or anxious. Plus, when you develop habits that
                promote self-care and relaxation, such as meditation or yoga,
                you can reduce stress and improve your overall well-being.

                <h2><li>Enhance Self-Discipline:</li></h2>
                Building better habits requires self-discipline, which is an
                essential trait for personal growth and success. When you
                develop habits that require you to be consistent and focused,
                you strengthen your self-discipline muscles. Over time, this can
                lead to greater self-control and willpower, which can help you
                achieve your goals in all areas of your life.

                    <p>
                        Before the electronic era, everyday reading was a ritual
                        that almost everyone who wanted to gain knowledge
                        adapted. The benefits of reading needed not to be
                        reminded all the time. Amongst other things, we have
                        been so preoccupied with social media and the internet
                        that hardly anyone contemplates reading books. While
                        some maybe too busy to read, others merely don't care to
                        read. There are many benefits to reading, from making
                        you smarter to improve your reading and writing skills

                <h2 id="steps">
                    Here's a step-by-step guide on how to build better habits:
                </h2>
                <article>
                    <h3><li>Identify Your Goals</li></h3>
                    <p>
                        The first step in building better habits is to identify
                        your goals. What do you want to achieve? Make sure your
                        goals are specific, measurable, and realistic. For
                        example, instead of saying
                        <em>"I want to exercise more,"</em> set a goal of
                        <em>"I want to exercise for 30 minutes every day."</em>
                    </p>

                    <h3><li>Start Small</li></h3>
                    <p>
                        Once you've identified your goals, it's time to start
                        building better habits. Start small by choosing one
                        habit to focus on at a time. It's important to start
                        with something that is easy to achieve, such as drinking
                        a glass of water every morning or going for a short walk
                        after dinner. By starting small, you'll be more likely
                        to stick with the habit and build momentum.
                    </p>

                    <h3><li>Create a Plan</li></h3>
                    <p>
                        Once you've chosen a habit to focus on, create a plan
                        for how you will implement it. Write down the habit you
                        want to develop, the specific actions you will take, and
                        when and where you will do them. This will help you stay
                        accountable and track your progress.
                    </p>

                    Reading exposes one to different kinds of knowledge. For
                    example, one who has read about coding will understand that
                    <p>
                        The function <code>selectAll()</code> highlights all the
                        text in the input field so the user can, for example,
                        copy or delete the text.
                    </p>

                    Whereas one who hasn't can't begin to fathom what is written
                    above not to mention that written below.
                    <p>Using CSS to change the font color is easy.</p>
                    <pre>
                    body {
                      color: yellow;
                    }
                    </pre>
                    <p>The code above changes the font color to yellow</p>
